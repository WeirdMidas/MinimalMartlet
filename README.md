# QoL Magisk/KSU Module
A magisk/KSU "quality of life" module (similar to minecraft QoL mods) designed to provide basic tweaks that improve the quality of life of the device that many modules sometimes fail to do.

The module is based on Minimal Butter, but adapted for all devices without brand limitations, at least Android 11 to 15.

Note: Due to some failures in my system (some parameters do not appear), some features were removed. I hope whoever is reading this understands.

## Features.
- Disabled Logs/Debugging that are not useful to the user.
- Some battery optimizations, such as throttling modern, rescheduling system services for later, and the encoder using less power to play videos.
- More to be added in the future. Remember that only QoL adjustments will be added here, no extreme adjustments.
