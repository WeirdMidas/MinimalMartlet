## Preview
A magisk/KSU "quality of life" module (similar to minecraft QoL mods) designed to provide basic tweaks that improve the quality of life of the device that many modules sometimes fail to do.

The module is based on Minimal Butter, but adapted for all devices without brand limitations, at least Android 11 to 15.

## Features
- Improved Doze Mode. Aggressive, but still allowing messages and notifications to be delivered to the user.
- Android's default Battery Saver Mode adjusted to be more power-saving, without penalizing device performance.
- Disabled Logs/Debugging that are not useful to the user.
- More to be added in the future. Remember that only QoL adjustments will be added here, no extreme adjustments.
